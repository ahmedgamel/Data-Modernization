# Data-Modernization

The company has a large volume of sales data generated from multiple stores. The data includes product information, sales transactions, customer details, and store-specific information. For data modernization, the data should be used for decision making, performing advanced data analytics, and transformation.

The data is collected from different data sources and stored in Azure SQL DB. Azure SQL DB will be the data source of the data platform.

Azure Databricks will be used to clean and enrich the data.
